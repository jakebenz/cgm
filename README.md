Documenting my journey of reverse-engineering the Dexcom G5 Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM).

This repository serves to host all of the information that I gather surrounding the Dexcom G5 CGM.

There are many topics covered, each of which has its own folder. I recommend reading the background page first, and working your way from there.

**If you are only interested in learning how I replaced my Dexcom G5 batteries, head to the battery-replacement folder.**
