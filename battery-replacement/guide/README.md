**What you'll need**:
-

1. A **tool to remove material from the top of the transmitter**. The cheapest way to do this is to buy a bench grinder ($40 at Harbor Freight) with an abrasive wheel, as shown in this photo.
2. **Replacement batteries**. Renata 389 is a direct replacement, but you may use SR44 (silver oxide) or LR44 (alkaline). The STL that I provide is designed to function with a Renata 389 or identically-sized 1.5V button cell battery. **You will need two batteries per transmitter**
3. Some sort of **epoxy or silicone sealant** to prevent water ingress following battery replacement
4. A **small pointed tool** to stab the spent batteries
5. A **razor blade** or utility knife to remove small amounts of material
6. A **3D-printed cover**, such as the one I have on this git ([HERE](https://github.com/jakebenz/cgm/blob/master/battery-replacement/G5_cover_nocutout.stl))

_Optional_:

- A spot welder to create a more robust electrical connection
- A brass wire brush to clean the battery contacts and terminals
