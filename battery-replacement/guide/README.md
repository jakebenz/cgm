**What you'll need**:
-

1. A **tool to remove material from the top of the transmitter**. The cheapest way to do this is to buy a bench grinder ($40 at Harbor Freight) with an abrasive wheel.

2. **Replacement batteries**. Renata 389 is a direct replacement, but you may use SR44 (silver oxide) or LR44 (alkaline). The STL that I provide is designed to function with a Renata 389 or identically-sized 1.5V button cell battery. **You will need two batteries per transmitter**.

3. Some sort of **epoxy or silicone sealant** to prevent water ingress following battery replacement

4. A **small pointed tool** to stab the spent batteries.
5. A **razor blade** or utility knife to remove small amounts of material.
6. A **3D-printed cover**, such as the one I have on this git ([HERE](https://github.com/jakebenz/cgm/blob/master/battery-replacement/G5_cover_nocutout.stl)).

_Optional_:

- A spot welder to create a more robust electrical connection.
- A brass wire brush to clean the battery contacts and terminals.


**Step 1: Remove surface material**
-

Carefully begin to remove material from the top of the transmitter, being sure to grind it relatively flat.

The surface after a bit of grinding.

You should stop grinding at this point and move to the razor or sharp pointed tool to remove the rest of the resin on top of the batteries and terminals.

**Step 2: Replace batteries**

Removing spot welds with utility knife. Cut toward your chum, not your thumb.

![Battery tab revealed](https://github.com/jakebenz/cgm-media/blob/master/battery-replacement-album/IMG_6329.JPG)

Here, one battery tab has been removed from the surface of the battery. Be careful with the tabs as they break easily.

I'm sure there's a better (read: safer) way of doing this, but I find that piercing the battery and prying it out is easiest. Be careful, wash your hands if you get any battery electrolyte on yourself.

![Pry the battery out](https://github.com/jakebenz/cgm-media/blob/master/battery-replacement-album/IMG_6344.JPG)

Pry the battery out, and then repeat the same process for the other battery.

![Both batteries removed](https://github.com/jakebenz/cgm-media/blob/master/battery-replacement-album/IMG_6356.JPG)

Both batteries removed. Time to put the new ones in.

![Push in the new batteries in the same orientation as the originals](https://github.com/jakebenz/cgm-media/blob/master/battery-replacement-album/IMG_6359.JPG)

Push in the new batteries in the same orientation as the originals. Positive terminal facing outward.

![Test the voltage](https://github.com/jakebenz/cgm-media/blob/master/battery-replacement-album/IMG_6368.JPG)

Test the battery voltage across the two terminals. It should read at least 1.55V.

**Step 3: Seal the transmitter with epoxy and 3D-printed cover**
-

![Get your epoxy ready](https://github.com/jakebenz/cgm-media/blob/master/battery-replacement-album/IMG_6390.JPG)
![Mix the epoxy well](https://github.com/jakebenz/cgm-media/blob/master/battery-replacement-album/IMG_6391.JPG)

Get your epoxy ready and mix it.

![Cover the batteries and terminals to prevent water ingress](https://github.com/jakebenz/cgm-media/blob/master/battery-replacement-album/IMG_6392.JPG)

Cover the batteries and terminals to prevent water ingress.

![Snap the 3D-printed cover on](https://github.com/jakebenz/cgm-media/blob/master/battery-replacement-album/IMG_6394.JPG)
![It snapped](https://github.com/jakebenz/cgm-media/blob/master/battery-replacement-album/IMG_6395.JPG)
![All epoxied up](https://github.com/jakebenz/cgm-media/blob/master/battery-replacement-album/IMG_6399.JPG)

Snap the 3D-printed cover on. If the material stresses too much, it may crack. Just cover the crack in epoxy if this happens.

**Step 4: Reset transmitter or pair with XDrip/Spike/Loop**
