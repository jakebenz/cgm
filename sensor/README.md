**Understanding the Dexcom G4/G5 sensor**
-

The Dexcom G4/G5 Sensor (hereafter "Sensor") is a medical device that comprises several components necessary for its utility.



1. **Adhesive fleece**, used to adhere to the skin.
2. **Sensing filament**, inserted subcutaneously to approximate blood glucose through measuring conductivity of interstitial fluid. Partially covered by a piece of shielding plasticâ€”perhaps teflon.
3. **Transmitter mount**, a molded piece of polycarbonate which houses the other components, as well as provides a means of mounting the Transmitter securely.
4. **Waterproof substrate**, a molded piece of silicone rubber designed to waterproof the electrical connection between the Sensing filament and the Transmitter.
5. **Conductive rubber**, two cylindrical pieces of conductive rubber material through which the Sensing filament passes, in order to electrically transmit the signal.

In order to approximate a blood glucose, the Sensor must measure some analog signal from its inserted Sensing filament and transmit this signal to the Transmitter, to be transduced into a digital signal and sent to the Receiver.
